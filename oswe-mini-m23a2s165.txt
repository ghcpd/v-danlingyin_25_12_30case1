User: prompt
You are a senior software engineer and technical documentation reviewer.
Your task is to evaluate whether the provided documentation is complete enough for developers to correctly use the APIs and components defined in the source code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Responsibilities
1.Identify incomplete documentation
- Review all documentation files
- Identify missing or insufficient information, such as:
- Missing parameter descriptions
- Missing return value documentation
- Missing error conditions
- Missing usage examples
- Missing required configuration steps
2.Compare against source code
- Inspect function and class definitions
- Identify undocumented but required behaviors
3.For each issue, report:
- Documentation file
- Section
- Missing information
- Why it is required (based on code)
- Code citation (file + line numbers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Classify severity
- High: API cannot be safely used without guessing
- Medium: Usage possible but unclear
- Low: Minor missing clarity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Produce improved documentation Generate:
- README_backup.md
- README.md (with missing info added)
Rules:
- Do NOT change code
- Do NOT invent behavior not present in code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.Generate report.json (similar structure as other doc audits)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Rules
- MUST prove incompleteness using code references
- MUST NOT assume user intent

GitHub Copilot — audit complete.

Summary
- I reviewed input.ts and README.md.
- I found missing/insufficient documentation (constructor validation, retry semantics, parameter types, errors, examples).
- I created: README_backup.md (original), updated README.md (expanded API reference + examples), and added report.json with a detailed findings list and severity classification.

What I changed (non-code, documentation only)
- Added README_backup.md — original README preserved.
- Rewrote README.md — added API reference, behavior, error conditions, examples.
- Added report.json — structured audit with code citations and severity.

Key undocumented issues (proof + severity)
1) Missing description of RetryOptions.retryCount
- Why required: callers need default and valid range to configure retries safely.
- Code proof: input.ts — RetryOptions definition and default/range logic (lines 2-4, 9-16).
- Severity: High

2) Constructor error behavior not documented
- Why required: constructor throws when `retryCount` outside 1..5 — must be handled by callers.
- Code proof: input.ts — validation + throw (lines 12-14).
- Severity: High

3) run(task) parameter/return semantics not documented
- Why required: `task` must return Promise<void>; `run` resolves on success and rejects with the last task error after retries.
- Code proof: input.ts — method signature and await (lines 19, 24).
- Severity: High

4) Retry semantics (counting, no delay/backoff) missing
- Why required: users must know retries are immediate and how attempts are counted.
- Code proof: input.ts — attempts initialization + loop (lines 20-26, 27-31).
- Severity: Medium

5) Missing usage examples for custom retryCount and final-error handling
- Why required: shows correct construction and error handling when retries exhausted.
- Code proof: input.ts — retry loop and final rethrow (lines 22-31).
- Severity: Medium

6) README doesn't state run returns Promise<void> (no task return value)
- Why required: callers may expect a return value from the task.
- Code proof: input.ts — run signature (line 19).
- Severity: Low

Files added/updated
- README_backup.md — original README (unchanged)
- README.md — updated with API reference, examples, behavior & errors
- report.json — audit report (structured issues + code citations)

If you'd like
- I can add more examples (backoff patterns, wrapping a task that returns a value).
- I can open a PR/commit message for these documentation changes.

If you want further edits or a different severity breakdown, tell me which part to adjust.

Made changes.
