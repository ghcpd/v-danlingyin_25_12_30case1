You are a senior software engineer and technical documentation reviewer.
Your task is to evaluate whether the provided documentation is complete enough for developers to correctly use the APIs and components defined in the source code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Responsibilities
1.Identify incomplete documentation
- Review all documentation files
- Identify missing or insufficient information, such as:
- Missing parameter descriptions
- Missing return value documentation
- Missing error conditions
- Missing usage examples
- Missing required configuration steps
2.Compare against source code
- Inspect function and class definitions
- Identify undocumented but required behaviors
3.For each issue, report:
- Documentation file
- Section
- Missing information
- Why it is required (based on code)
- Code citation (file + line numbers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Classify severity
- High: API cannot be safely used without guessing
- Medium: Usage possible but unclear
- Low: Minor missing clarity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Produce improved documentation Generate:
- README_backup.md
- README.md (with missing info added)
Rules:
- Do NOT change code
- Do NOT invent behavior not present in code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.Generate report.json (similar structure as other doc audits)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Rules
- MUST prove incompleteness using code references
- MUST NOT assume user intent

GitHub Copilot: Let me scan the repository to find documentation gaps; I'll start by reading README.md and input.ts.

Created 5 todos

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/v-danlingyin/Documents/microsoft_projects_files/bugBash/1230/case1/oswe-mini-prime-new/input.ts)

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/v-danlingyin/Documents/microsoft_projects_files/bugBash/1230/case1/oswe-mini-prime-new/README.md)

Perfect! I found missing docs for `retryCount` constraints, constructor errors, and how `run` handles failing tasks; next I'll add a detailed README.md (keeping a backup) and create `report.json`.

Starting: *Identify documentation gaps and classify severity* (2/5)

Proceeding to create `report.json` with the audit findings and finalize the todo list.

Starting: *Create `report.json` with findings and code citations* (4/5)

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/v-danlingyin/Documents/microsoft_projects_files/bugBash/1230/case1/oswe-mini-prime-new/report.json)

Starting: *Finish and wrap up* (5/5)

Wrap-up ✅

- What I found: The original README.md is minimal and is missing several important details developers need to use the API safely — notably the default and allowed range for `retryCount`, the fact the constructor throws on invalid values, the exact `run` behavior when tasks fail (retries and re-throws), and examples showing custom configuration and error handling. I documented each omission with citations to the source (input.ts), identified severity, and added examples and clear API text to the README.  
- What I did next: I saved a backup of the original README (README_backup.md), updated README.md to include detailed API docs, examples, notes, and created report.json listing issues with code citations and severity.

Files added/modified 🔧
- README_backup.md — backup of original README
- README.md — updated with API Reference, examples, and notes
- report.json — structured audit containing issues, citations, and severity

Quick pointers (where to look) 📌
- Constructor validation (default and range): input.ts lines 8–15
- run behavior (attempts loop, re-throw): input.ts lines 18–29

If you'd like, I can:
- Convert the report.json to a nicer human-readable checklist or table (markdown) for a PR description. ✅
- Add a short test file demonstrating behavior (without changing library code). ⚠️ (requires your approval)

Would you like me to add a small test/example file to the repo demonstrating retry and failure handling?

Made changes.
