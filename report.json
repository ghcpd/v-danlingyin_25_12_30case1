      "missing_information": "Default value and allowed range for `retryCount` (and that the constructor throws if out-of-range).",
      "why_required": "The constructor sets a default (3) and validates `retryCount` to be between 1 and 5, throwing if not; without this, users cannot safely configure retries.",
      "code_citation": "input.ts lines 8-15: `const count = options.retryCount ?? 3;` and `if (count < 1 || count > 5) { throw new Error(\"retryCount must be between 1 and 5\"); }`",

      "section": "API / run",
      "missing_information": "The required `task` signature and exact retry behavior: that `run` attempts the task up to `retryCount` times, returns on first success, and re-throws the last error after final failure.",
      "why_required": "Users need to know how many attempts to expect, how errors are surfaced, and how to handle them. The code implements a loop and re-throws the last error.",

      "why_required": "Practical examples reduce misuse and demonstrate correct error handling (the code throws after final attempt, see lines 26-29).",

      "missing_information": "Clarify that synchronous throws from the `task` function are treated the same as rejected promises (i.e., counted as a failed attempt).",
      "why_required": "The implementation uses `await task()` inside try/catch so both thrown and rejected errors are caught and retried; documenting this prevents surprises.",
