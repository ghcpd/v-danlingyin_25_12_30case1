    {
      "documentationFile": "README.md",
      "section": "API / RetryOptions.retryCount",
      "missingInformation": "No description of `retryCount` (type, default value, allowed range).",
      "whyRequired": "Users need to know the default number of attempts and valid values to choose appropriate retry behavior and avoid constructor errors.",
      "codeCitation": "input.ts: lines 2-4 (type) and lines 9-16 (default & range validation)",
      "severity": "High",
      "recommendation": "Document `retryCount` type, default (3), and allowed range (1-5); show example using a custom value."

      "documentationFile": "README.md",
      "section": "Constructor behavior / errors",
      "missingInformation": "Documentation does not state that the constructor throws when `retryCount` is outside the range 1..5.",
      "whyRequired": "Callers must know the constructor can throw so they can validate input or catch the error at construction time.",
      "codeCitation": "input.ts: lines 12-14 (throw if out of range)",
      "severity": "High",
      "recommendation": "Add explicit note that constructor will throw for invalid `retryCount` values."

      "documentationFile": "README.md",
      "section": "run(task) — parameter & return behavior",
      "missingInformation": "Missing type/signature and semantics for `task` (that it must return `Promise<void>`), and that `run` returns `Promise<void>` resolving on success.",
      "whyRequired": "Developers need correct function signature and knowledge of how/when the returned promise resolves or rejects to correctly integrate the API.",
      "codeCitation": "input.ts: lines 19 and 24 (method signature and await task())",
      "severity": "High",
      "recommendation": "Document the expected `task` signature and that `run` resolves when `task` succeeds and rejects with the last task error after retries are exhausted."
    },
    {
      "documentationFile": "README.md",
      "section": "Retry semantics & timing",
      "missingInformation": "No mention that retries occur immediately with no delay/backoff, and exactly how attempts are counted.",
      "whyRequired": "Knowing if there is a delay/backoff affects how callers implement transient-failure handling and whether they should add delays themselves.",
      "codeCitation": "input.ts: lines 20-26 and 27-31 (attempts counter and immediate loop)",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "recommendation": "State that there is no built-in delay/backoff and clarify attempt counting (up to `retryCount` attempts)."
    },

      "documentationFile": "README.md",
      "section": "Usage examples / error handling",
      "missingInformation": "No example showing custom `retryCount` or how to catch the error after retries are exhausted.",
      "whyRequired": "Practical examples lower risk of misuse and demonstrate correct error-handling patterns.",
      "codeCitation": "input.ts: lines 22-31 (retry loop and rethrow)",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "recommendation": "Add examples for custom retry counts and handling the final thrown error."

      "documentationFile": "README.md",
      "section": "Return values / task results",
      "missingInformation": "No statement that `run` returns `Promise<void>` and does not propagate a task return value.",
      "whyRequired": "Callers must know the API does not return a task result and cannot be used to obtain values from the task.",
      "codeCitation": "input.ts: line 19 (Promise<void> signature)",
      "severity": "Low",
      "recommendation": "Document that `run` returns `Promise<void>` and the task should handle any results itself."
