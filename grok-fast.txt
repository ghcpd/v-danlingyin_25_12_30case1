You are a senior software engineer and technical documentation reviewer.
Your task is to evaluate whether the provided documentation is complete enough for developers to correctly use the APIs and components defined in the source code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Responsibilities
1.Identify incomplete documentation
- Review all documentation files
- Identify missing or insufficient information, such as:
- Missing parameter descriptions
- Missing return value documentation
- Missing error conditions
- Missing usage examples
- Missing required configuration steps
2.Compare against source code
- Inspect function and class definitions
- Identify undocumented but required behaviors
3.For each issue, report:
- Documentation file
- Section
- Missing information
- Why it is required (based on code)
- Code citation (file + line numbers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Classify severity
- High: API cannot be safely used without guessing
- Medium: Usage possible but unclear
- Low: Minor missing clarity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Produce improved documentation Generate:
- README_backup.md
- README.md (with missing info added)
Rules:
- Do NOT change code
- Do NOT invent behavior not present in code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.Generate report.json (similar structure as other doc audits)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Rules
- MUST prove incompleteness using code references
- MUST NOT assume user intent

I've completed the evaluation of the documentation against the source code in input.ts. Here's a summary:

## Issues Identified
The current README.md lacks critical API details, making it incomplete for safe and correct usage. Key gaps include:
- No documentation for the `RetryOptions` interface.
- Missing constructor details (parameters, defaults, validation).
- Insufficient `run` method documentation (parameters, behavior, errors).
- Basic usage example doesn't demonstrate configuration options.

## Files Generated
- README_backup.md: Exact copy of the original documentation.
- README.md: Improved version with added API reference section, detailed descriptions, and an enhanced usage example.
- report.json: Structured report of all identified issues, including severity classifications.

All improvements are based directly on the source code behavior—no assumptions or inventions were made. The documentation now provides complete information for developers to use the APIs safely.

Made changes.
